 ## Type Casting
 Type casting is a way to check the type of a varible. We can also down cast a variable to a different subclass of its type. For example, we could downcast a `UIView` as a `UIButton` since the button is a subclass of `UIView`.
 There are a few operators in Swift we can use to handle type casting.
 */
/*:
 - Callout(Operator: 'is'):
 We can use the 'is' operator to check if an instance is one of its subclasses
 */
/*:
 - Callout(Operator: 'as?'):
 We can use the 'as?' to attempt a downcast of an instance. Note the '?', meaning this will return an optional value. If the downcast is not possible, nil will be returned.
 */
/*:
 - Callout(Operator: 'as!'):
 We can use the 'as!' to downcast and do a force unwrap of the value in one step. Only use this if you are sure the downcast will succeed.
 */

//: We can look at an example using UIView and UIButton from Apple's UIKit

// Here we declare a variable of type UIView and we assign a UIButton instance to 'myView'
// This is valid since UIButton subclasses UIView
let myView: UIView = UIButton()

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Try using the `is` operator on `myView`. Take a look at the evaluation on the right to see what the results are. ie: `myView is UIView`. Try checking if `myView` is any of the following views: `UIButton`, `UITableView`, `UIImageView`
 */
myView is UIView
myView is UIButton
myView is UITableView
myView is UIImageView

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Because 'myView' is a UIView, we can't call UIButton specific methods such as 'setTitle'
 */

//myView.setTitle("Test", for: .normal) // The compiler will complain about this code!
//myVIew.setTitle("Test", for: .normal)

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Here we downcast our `myView` variable to an actual UIButton using `as?`. Try changing the type of class you downcast to and check what the behaviour is. For example, what happens when you try to downcast `myView` to a `UITableView`? What happens if you use `as!`?
 */

let myCastedButtonView = myView as? UIButton

//crash if I use as!
//the constant get set to nil if it is not downcast to the correct type

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Now that we downcast our `myView` to an actual UIButton, use conditional unwrapping to ensure it is not nil, then try calling the `setTitle` method to ensure it can be called.
 */
if let MyButtonView = myView as? UIButton{
  MyButtonView.setTitle("Test", for: .normal)
}

/*:
 - Callout(Challenge):
 Every `UIView` has a property called `subviews` that is an array of all of it's subviews. `view.subviews`. Imagine we had a UIView containing many different types of subviews.
 */

let view = UIView()
view.addSubview(UIButton())
view.addSubview(UIButton())
view.addSubview(UILabel())
view.addSubview(UITextField())
view.addSubview(UILabel())
view.addSubview(UIButton())
/*:
 And we need to find all buttons. Write a function to search for `UIButtons` in this view's `subviews`, and return an array will all the buttons.

 - Callout(Challenge - Part 1):
 Finish the implementation of the `Movie` class and `Song` class. The `Movie` class will have a new property called `director` to store the director's name. The `Song` class will have a new property called `artist` to store the artist's name. Ensure you add their respective initializer methods as well to setup their properties.
